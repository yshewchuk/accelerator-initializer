## Code of Conduct

Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/scotiabank/accelerator-initializer/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Submitting Code

#### Scotiabank is committed to enriching the developer community through open source collaboration. We’ve just begun this exciting journey with all of you! At present, we’re only accepting contributions from individuals with whom we have a prior agreement. Stay tuned for more updates from us!

When submitting code:

**In order to help reviewers reason about the changes and implications of changes, try to submit small pull requests that represent a single feature or change.**

1. Write your code
   * When creating new API endpoints ensure they are documented to allow Swagger generation
   * TODO: Pick a style guide to follow

2. Write tests:
   * Ensure your code is covered by unit tests
      * Unit tests will test individual classes and methods
      * Unit test coverage required: 80%
      * Unit test coverage target: 95%
   * Ensure that integration tests are written
      * Integration tests will test at the API level
         * Will test the components together
         * Verify the dependency injection is injecting the correct components
         * Should verify multiple configurations (for example, if multiple output formats are allowed, should test both)
      * Integration test coverage will be measured separately
      * Integration test coverage target: 90% (currently much lower, but enforcement will slowly increase)

3. Ensure you can build
   ```
   gradlew clean assemble
   ```
   
4. Ensure all tests pass
   ```
   gradlew check
   ```
   
5. Submit a pull request with your changes
   * Give your pull request a descriptive title
   * Include a description of the changes you've made
      * Summarize the changes
      * Describe the implications of the changes
      * Include the intent of the change
